It seems that all data points has been shifted up by 50 units. That is all y+50.

There are 4 types of signals located in following intervals approximately:

Base ("Noise") (See base.txt)

1-200

750-1150

1700-2100

2650-3050

3550-3950

4500-4900

5400-5750

6500-6650

7450-7600

8420-8540

9360-9480

TypeA1+Base (See typeA1.txt)

201-749

1151-1699

2101-2649

3051-3549

3951-4499

4901-5399

TypeC+Base (See typeC.txt)

5751-6499

6651-7300

7800-8220

8780-9150

9720-10000

TyteA2+Base (Basically same with TypeA1 with higher frequency and smaller amplitude)

7301-7449

7601-7799

8221-8419

8541-8779

9151-9359
