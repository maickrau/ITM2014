Information Theoretic Modeling
Project : De Compression Competition

Instructions
============

Say 'make test' in order to compress and decompress files using your
programs, and to check that the result is ok. E.g.,

---------------------------------------------------------------------
> make test
data/curve1.dat: 14832 -> *482 + 14832 (100%) = 15314 (103%) Ok.
data/curve2.dat: 31568 -> *482 + 31568 (100%) = 32050 (101%) Ok.
data/info.xpm: 15527 -> 482 + 15527 (100%) = 16009 (103%) Ok.
data/letter.dat: 20000 -> *482 + 20000 (100%) = 20482 (102%) Ok.
data/mushroom.dat: 8124 -> *482 + 8124 (100%) = 8606 (105%) Ok.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

says that the files curve1, curve2, info, letter, and mushroom were
all handled ok. For instance, the file curve1.dat was originally 14832
bytes, it was compressed and decompressed using side information (the
'*' says that) using a 482 byte decompressor program. The compressed
version was 14832 bytes (small wonder; the sample program just prints
its input), giving a total of 15314 bytes. The total score was
15314 + 32050 + 16009 + 20482 + 8606 bytes.

In order to deliver your solution say 'make tar' in this directory, rename 
the resulting file as <group-name>.tgz, where <group-name> is your group's
name, and send the file to teemu.roos@cs.helsinki.fi AND
jussi.maatta@helsinki.fi .

Files
=====

index.html         - your document
figures            - a directory for possible diagrams etc. in your
                     document. Have relative references in your HTML
data/*.dat         - data to be compressed, e.g.:
data/curve1.dat    - first data set
sdata/*.sdat       - side information (not available for all files; same prefix as the data)
runtest.sh         - test script (do not edit! if there is a problem,
                     contact Teemu or Jussi)
decompressor/      - a directory for decompress.sh script, decompressing program source and 
                     anything else required to decompress. All items in this directory, 
                     and sub directories inside, would be counted
compressor/        - a directory for compress.sh, compressing program source, and anything else
                     required to perform compression. 
compress.sh        - a script invoking your compressor
decompress.sh      - a script invoking your de-compressor
